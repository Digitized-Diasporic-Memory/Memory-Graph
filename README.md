# Diasporic Memory Graph

This interactive network graph is part of the [Digitized Diasporic Memory](diasporamemory.com/) graduate thesis project. The present web application, built on top of [Logseq](logseq.com/), contains over 130 audio snippets crowd-sourced from Black people of African-descent living on Turtle Island. Participants were invited to respond to each other asynchronously and during a series of synchronous recording sessions.

Come explore our interactive chain of memories!

## You can access the live version of the network graph here → https://demo.diasporamemory.com/

# Getting Started
1. Click on the "Graph" button at the top-right.

2. Explore the networked chain on memories. Each circle/node is an audio recording, and every line/edge represents a relationship between audio segments.

3. To hear a clip, click on the circle/node (this function only works on desktop). Alternately, you can browse the list of audio recordings here.

4. Click on one of the "Connected Thoughts" and "Linked References" to follow the chain of memories!

# About the Diasporic Memory
As part of the Digitized Diasporic Memory thesis project, I conducted a month-long study with seven people of African descent residing on Turtle Island. The participants and I met for a series of workshops and remote audio recording sessions where we developed prompts and shared memories.

These audio segments were submitted to a collaborative database, allowing other participants to respond to each other both synchronously and asynchronously. Participants engaged in cross-cultural sense-making, building upon the previous speaker’s remarks with reference points from their respective cultures.

In the end, over 130 audio segments of over 2hrs of recording were catalogued in the database. The audio recordings are licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) and [have been made available for download](https://diasporamemory.com/database/).

# Land Acknowledgement
I would like to take the time to honour the original owners and custodians of the land on which we inhabit and create. The present thesis was conceived while I was residing on Anishinābe Akì Territory and in T’karonto, the ancestral territory of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Anishinābe, the Wendat, the Chippewa, and the Mississaugas of the Credit River First Nations.

In the introduction to Hungry Listening: Resonant Theory for Indigenous Sound Studies, Dylan Robinson (2020) invites us to consider our listening biases, listening privilege, and listening ability as part of our critical listening positionality (p. 10). As the author explains, “by becoming aware of normative listening habits and abilities, we are better able to listen otherwise” (p. 11).

As a guest on these lands, I am committed to listening to Indigenous people and working towards the strengthening of solidarity between Black and Indigenous communities. I will continue to reflect on my geographic positioning, connection to indigeneity, understanding of embodied place, relationship to settler-coloniality, and decolonial justice.
